# SingleCycleProcessor-Nexys3-FPGA
This single cycle processor is designed with a Harvard architecture, meaning it has separate memory spaces for instructions and data, enabling simultaneous access and increasing throughput. The processor architecture is similar to the MIPS instruction set and supports three major categories of instructions: R-Type, I-Type, and J-Type.
